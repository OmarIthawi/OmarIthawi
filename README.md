## Islam

In the Name of Allaah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. 
I call you with the call of Islam. Become Muslim and you will be safe,
and Allaah will grant you a two-fold reward.

I'm letting you know that there's an answer to why you exist,
and what you should do in this life.

Send me an email to: i@omardo.com and I'll be happy to show you.



This is the same message that prophet Mohammed (peace upon him) have sent to to Heraclius the king of Byzantium 1400 years ago.

> #### From the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Heraclius the king of Byzantium
> In the Name of Allaah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad the slave and Messenger of Allaah to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantium. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance. I call you with the call of Islam. Become Muslim and you will be safe, and Allaah will grant you a two-fold reward, but if you turn away, upon you will be the sins of the Areesiyyeen (peasants i.e., his followers and subjects who would follow him in kufr).
> ‘Say (O Muhammad): “O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allaah (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allaah. Then, if they turn away, say: “Bear witness that we are Muslims”’
> (Aal ‘Imraan 3:64).

The same message is still true, and the call exists. It's your turn to choose the right path for your own salvation.
